# Conflict-Based Search (CBS) for Multi-Agent Pathfinding

This project implements **Conflict-Based Search (CBS)** for solving multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems on large directed graphs. It was developed as part of my work in the **Parallel and Distributed Computing Lab at Simon Fraser University (SFU)**.  

### Key Highlights
- Efficient **conflict detection and resolution** for multiple agents  
- Extended CBS with **agent size constraints (height/width)** for robotics navigation scenarios  
- Designed for scalability and correctness, with test cases and logging  

### Access
The full implementation is hosted in a **private SFU GitHub repository**.  
- I can provide a **live demo** during interviews (by signing in with my SFU account).  
- Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss the details or see the project in action.
